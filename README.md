By the light of the full moon, we present…The Hack Club Haunted House.

Every event we’ve done has broken the boundaries of what’s possible. Previously, we’ve [coded on a train, hacked in San Francisco,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnK4gzO6S3Q) [held a New Year's coding party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLx4NZZPzMc), and went on [an outdoors coding adventure](https://outernet.hackclub.com/). This Halloween, we wanted to cast a hacking spell unheard of before: a hackathon inside a haunted house.

Join us on Hallow's Eve, from October 28-29th in the heart of Chicago, for a weekend of frights, sights, and bytes

The premise of Haunted House is simple: we’re going to be making a virtual haunted house. We’ll provide a site that links to another site, which links to another site. The goal? Make the scariest haunted house experience possible, all through the power of the web. Jumpscares and spooky scary skeletons galore–let’s make this event truly bone-chilling.

It’s going to be a lot of fun with all the friends you’ll make and all the projects you’ll build. Get started by heading over to haunted.hackclub.com to get started, and we hope to see you there!

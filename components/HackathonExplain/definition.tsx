          This Hallow’s Eve, we’re dare to push the boundaries of innovation by
          drawing inspiration from the supernatural surroundings of the
          Halloween season. In the dusk of the full moon, we convene to immerse
          ourselves in the enigmatic ambiance of a Haunted House.
          <br />
          <br />
          Embark on an otherworldly odyssey to craft your very own virtual
          Haunted House in the boundless realms of the interwebs. Our quest?
          Weave a tapestry of web-based projects which will reside in individual
          “rooms”, and when the weekend wanes, projects will be linked together
          to form a larger haunted manor with interlinked rooms

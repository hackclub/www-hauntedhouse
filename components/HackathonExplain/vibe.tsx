          At Haunted House, we're building a haunted house on the interwebs.
          We’ll provide an “entry point” that links to the website you made,
          which will then link to another participant’s website. By linking all
          of these sites together we'll have created an epic multi-room virtual
          haunted house that you can share with friends and family.
